CPSC312
=======
Project 1 Notes:
* adding history exclusion by list difference added a fairly large performance hit
  * heuristics could be used to make such boards never be considered but this requires some more thoughts
* ~~look into using char instead of String for B/W just so that we aren't doing c!!0 in that one spot....~~
* look into lazy concatenation in generation
* Heuristics should prefer earlier victory
* I wouldn't mind having some type decs in there
* COMMENTSCOMMENTSCOMMENTSCOMMENTSCOMMENTS
 * I commented the MINIMAX stuff
* ~~write a top level function which constructs the proper output~~
